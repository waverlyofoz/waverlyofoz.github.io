# Personal Blog

## Creating new posts

1. Create a new `my-post-name.md` file under `docs/blog/posts/`, being sure to name the file something short and descriptive. You can copy `template.md` to get you started.
2. When you're ready to post, remove `draft: true` from the top of the file, or change it to `draft: false`.
3. Commit the new/changed file and in a minute or so, the change will be live at [https://waverlyofoz.github.io/](https://waverlyofoz.github.io/).
